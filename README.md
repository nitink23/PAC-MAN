# PAC-MAN PROJECT

This a Pac man simulation where you can add pac man's to the sceen and they bounce around. we used majority javascript to do this project. you hit the add button to add the pacman and if you want to add more pac men and if you want to strat game just hit the start game button. LET THE CHAOS ENUSE AFTER THAT !!!!!! 
TO run this project all you need to do it fork the files and open the index.html file. launch the index.html page and hit the start game button very simple.
in the future I plan to add a few more pac man deisgns and alot more boundaries to make it look like actual pacman.
